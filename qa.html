        <h3>A Customer is angry at me and wants to speak to a manager, what do I do?</h3>                       
        <p>
          Maintain your composure and calmly let the customer know that you will get a manager involved. 
          Reach out to the M.O.D away from the customer to ensure you can brief the M.O.D of the situation, and then follow the M.O.D back to the customer to witness the interaction.
          <br><br>Use this situation as a learning experience to better understand the customer feelings and try to pick up on the techniques the M.O.D will use to calm the angry customer.
        </p> 
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>What is an M.O.D?</h3>
        <p>M.O.D stands for the Manager On Duty, or the acting manager at a given moment. This role will change managers throughout the day as each manager takes breaks or leaves. The M.O.D is not a specific role
          but rather used as a person of first contact when an employee needs help.

        <h3>There has been a chemical spill in the geek squad precinct, what should we do?</h3>                       
        <p>
          If there has been a chemical spill, <i>immediately</i> evacuate the area and get the M.O.D involved to handle the situation. General employees 
          are not allowed to clean chemical spills without proper training.

        <h3>I told a customer that the item they want is in stock, but when I looked it wasn't there.</h3>                       
        <p>
          If the item states that it is in stock in our system, ask for some help from one of the warehouse associates as they may know of another location it may be.
          <br><br>
          If the item is not in stock in our store or it is missing, check other bestbuy store locations and inform the customer they may be able to pick it up today at another location.<br>
          <i>Make sure the stock level is at least over 2 or call the store to verify current stock before placing the order!</i><br><br>
          Lastly appologise to the customer for the inconveniance and assure them we will find a way to get it in their hands as fast as possible!

        <h3>Where can I find all of my pay and time information?</h3>                       
        <p>
          All of your pay information can be accessed in store or outside of BestBuy using the BestBuy Connect web application.<br>
          Your current working hours can be accessed in store through TLC using any register or the BestBuy Connect app.<br>

        <h3>I need to stay home as I'm sick, what do I do?</h3>                       
        <p>
          Call the store directly and dial #2110 to send your call to the customer service desk and ask for the M.O.D to let them know you will be unable to come in today.
          You can also call your manager directly if you know they will be at work at the time of your call. <br>
          <i><b>If your call is not answered, call again. If noone picks up and you dont call again it will count as a No Call, No Show, and could end in you getting fired!</b></i>

        <h3>How long can I go on my break?</h3>                       
        <p>
          You can have a 15 minute break every 4 shift hours, and an unpaid lunch break (30 Minutes to 1 Hour) if you have a shift over 5 Hours. 
          That being said Lunch breaks are mandated by Illinois Law if your shift is over 7.5 Hours in length!

        <h3>How do I figure out who is the Manager on Duty?</h3>                       
        <p>
          Either ask another employee if they know or use your personal earpiece radio to call out in the store and ask for the M.O.D!
          There is also a paper schedule in the front of the store with the employee schedules so you can check there as well.

        <h3>Is there a person I can talk to about harrassment issues at work?</h3>                       
        <p>
          <strong>YES!</strong><br> You can talk to any manager you feel comfortable with about the issue or if you would rather it remain an 
          anonymous tip, there is the BestBuy employee helpline. For more information on this helpline follow the Emergency tab in the top and choose Helpline!
